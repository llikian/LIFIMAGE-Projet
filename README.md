# LIFIMAGE-Projet

## Structure
The main programs for each part of the project are in src: src/analyse.cpp and src/synthese.cpp
respectively. The other files are in folders named according to which part of the project they belong
to so files for "analyse" are in src/analyse and include/analyse and files for "synthese" are in
src/synthese and include/synthese.
